# 🌤️ SkyNote – A Mood-Based Weather Experience

**SkyNote** is a beautifully designed weather web app that brings emotion to forecasting. It doesn't just show weather — it *feels* it.

Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and powered by the **Weatherbit API**, SkyNote visualizes weather data through dynamic mood-based themes, soft gradients, and interactive UI elements. From peaceful sunny mornings to stormy nights, the app responds with a smooth transition of colors, icons, and animations that reflect the true nature of the sky.
